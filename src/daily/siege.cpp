// Note: this file is encoded in the PC-8 / Code Page 437 / OEM-US character set
// (The same character set used by Liberal Crime Squad when it is running)
// Certain special characters won't display correctly unless your text editor is
// set to use that character set, such as this e with an accent: ‚
// In Windows Notepad with the Terminal font, OEM/DOS encoding it should work fine.
// You can set this in Notepad by going to Format->Font and choosing the Terminal font,
// then choosing OEM/DOS in the Script dropdown box.
// In Notepad++ go to the Encoding menu, Character sets, Western European, OEM-US... easy!
// In Code::Blocks's editor go to Settings->Editor->the Other Settings tab and
// then pick WINDOWS-437 from the dropdown box and then choose the radio button
// to make this the default encoding and disable auto-detection of the encoding.
// Then close the file and reopen it (since Code::Blocks detects the encoding
// when it opens the file and it can't be changed after that; what we changed was
// how it detects encoding for files it opens in the future, not files already open).
// In Microsoft Visual C++, right-click the file in the Solution Explorer,
// select CONST_siege000, choose CONST_siegeB247,
// then choose CONST_siege001.
// In MS-DOS Editor (included with Windows as EDIT.COM in your system32 directory),
// the codepage will be correct already since it's running in a console window just
// like Liberal Crime Squad. Well OK, the encoding might be wrong, but then it's wrong
// in Liberal Crime Squad TOO, and to fix it, go to Control Panel, Regional and Language Settings,
// Advanced tab, and choose English (United States) from the dropdown box as the encoding
// for non-Unicode applications, then press OK.
// If you have a Linux or other UNIX-based system you are obviously smart enough
// to figure out for yourself how to open a file in OEM-US PC-8 codepage 437 in
// your favorite text editor. If you're on Mac OS X, well that's UNIX-based, figure
// it out for yourself.
