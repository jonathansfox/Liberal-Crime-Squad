## Liberal Crime Squad

Welcome to Liberal Crime Squad! The Conservatives have taken the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government. Over time, the Liberal laws of this nation will erode and turn the country into a BACKWOODS YET CORPORATE NIGHTMARE. To prevent this from happening, the Liberal Crime Squad was established. The mood of the country is shifting, and we need to turn things around. Go out on the streets and indoctrinate Conservative automatons. That is, let them see their True Liberal Nature. Then arm them and send them forth to Stop Evil.

This version of Liberal Crime Squad is an unofficial transfer from SourceForge. A full list of authors is available in AUTHORS.

Read COMPILE_README.txt for instructions on how to compile on all platforms.

## Augmentations

This version of Liberal Crime Squad includes changes such as small bug fixes, game mechanic tweaks so that it plays better, and new features, such as the new Augmentation system!

The fight against the Conservative Swine is a long and dangerous one, and Liberals need every advantage they can get. As we turn to modern technology, we find yet another way to help the Liberal Cause: We can make our Liberals faster, stronger, and better than ever before through the use of Augmentations!

To tap into this newfound science, Activate a Liberal who has a science skill of 1 or greater, go into the 'D - Recruitment' menu, and '5 - Augment' task. From here, you can select a Brave Liberal Pioneer to test this new technology and advance the Liberal Cause.

## Save Files

You can now have multiple save files! When you load up LCS, you have the option to choose from previous save files or make a new one. So you can now hold the battle against the Conservative Swine in multiple dimensions!

Go Forth, and Pursue your Liberal Agenda!

## New For 4.12

Savefile Editor: art/debug_defines.txt
// Store savefiles in plaintext, making it human readable and editable
//VERBOSESAVEFILE
Remove the '//' from VERBOSESAVEFILE and every .dat save file will be accompanied by a .verbose save file, intended to be mostly human readable.

The 287 files of custom strings have been sorted into 17 folders placed inside the art folder, and the art folder itself.

.\allText.txt (something of a massive text dump)
.\debug_defines.txt (used to alter debug options)
.\defaultSlogans.txt (change the default slogans, but that only activates once in 20 anyway)
.\helpTopics.txt (in-game help topics)

activities (mostly have to do with personnel descriptions and hotwiring cars)

chase (mostly car chase stuff)

creature (customize the names of Hicks and CCS members!)

date
